Major update from  6.5.x to version 7.0.0
=========================================

This is a guide for updating OXID eShop 6.5.x to OXID eShop 7.0.0. If you do not have the newest patch release of 6.5,
you should first update to this patch release. A helping approach regarding the update is to deactivate all modules
and then successively activate them after the update. Read the documentation about all changes carefully. In some
cases you have to take actions, in some cases not. This depends on your OXID eShop, the modules, user data or the theme
you are using.
The update manual is divided into several chapters:
