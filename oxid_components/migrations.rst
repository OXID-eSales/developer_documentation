Migrations
==========

OXID eShop uses database migrations for eShop setup and updates. Migration tool can be used for project
specific migrations too.

Infrastructure
--------------

At the moment OXID eShop uses "Doctrine 2 Migrations" and it's integrated via OXID eShop migration components.

Doctrine Migrations runs migrations with a single configuration. There is a need to run several configurations (suites)
of migrations for OXID eShop project. For example one for Community Edition, one for Enterprise Edition and one for a project.
For this reason `OXID eShop Doctrine Migration Wrapper <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop-doctrine-migration-wrapper>`__
was created.

Doctrine Migration Wrapper needs some information about the OXID eShop installation like:

- what edition is active
- what are credentials for database

This information is gathered from `OXID eShop Facts <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop-facts>`__.
Facts has a class which can provide an information about OXID eShop and it's environment. This component is Shop
independent and can be used without bootstrap. The only restriction is to have config.inc.php file configured.

Usage
-----

Running migrations - CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script to run migrations is registered to composer bin directory. It accept two parameters:

- Doctrine command
- Edition

.. code:: bash

   vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate migrations:migrate

This command will run all the migrations which are in OXID eShop specific directories. For example if you have
OXID eShop Enterprise edition, migration tool will run migrations in this order:

* Community Edition migrations
* Professional Edition migrations
* Enterprise Edition migrations
* Project specific migrations

In case you have Community Edition:

* Community Edition migrations
* Project specific migrations

It is also possible to run migrations for specific suite by defining environment variable - **MIGRATION_SUITE**.
This variable defines what type of migration it is. There are 4 types:

* **PR** - For project specific migrations. It should be always used for project development.
* **CE** - Generates migration file for OXID eShop Community Edition. **It's used for product development only**.
* **PE** - Generates migration file for OXID eShop Professional Edition. **It's used for product development only**.
* **EE** - Generates migration file for OXID eShop Enterprise Edition. **It's used for product development only**.

Generate migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate migrations:generate

This command will create shop views by current eShop version, edition and configuration.
It is a best practice to run it right after migrations command.

Generate migration for a single suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate migrations:generate PR

This command will generate new migration. Migration class will be generated to specific directory according **MIGRATION_SUITE**
variable. In this case it will be generated in `source/migration/project_data/` directory.

Run Doctrine 2 Migrations commands
----------------------------------

Sometimes there will be a need to run doctrine specific commands. To do so run Doctrine Migrations command:

.. code:: bash

   vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate DOCTRINE_COMMAND

For example, you would like to get the list of doctrine migrations available commands:

.. code:: bash

   vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate

More information on how to use Doctrine 2 Migrations can be found in official documentation page:
http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-migrations/en/latest/

Using Doctrine Migrations Wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Doctrine Migration Wrapper is written in PHP and could be used without command line interface.
To do so:

- Create ``Migrations`` object with ``MigrationsBuilder->build()``
- Call ``execute`` method with needed parameters
