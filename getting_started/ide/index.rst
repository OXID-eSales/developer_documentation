Setting Up Your IDE
===================

To develop with OXID eShop, we highly recommend working with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

These howtos rely on an :doc:`installed OXID eShop </getting_started/installation/index>` on a running
`OXID eShop VM <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop>`__.

If you are using a different environment, this documentation might change slightly.
