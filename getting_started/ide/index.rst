Setting Up Your IDE
===================

Working with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is highly recommended in order to develop with OXID eShop.

These howtos rely on an :doc:`installed OXID eShop </getting_started/installation/index>` on a running
`OXID eShop VM <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop>`__.
If you are using a different environment, this documentation might change slightly.
