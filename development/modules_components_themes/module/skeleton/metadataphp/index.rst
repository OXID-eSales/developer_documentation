metadata.php
============

Since OXID eShop version 4.9.0 / 5.2.0
(`Release notes <https://docs.oxid-esales.com/eshop/de/5.3/releases/releases-2014/oxid-eshop-490520.html>`__)
each module has to have metadata set. This has to be done with a file :file:`metadata.php` in the module's root directory.

.. note::

    Support of metadata version 1, 1.1 and 1.2 was dropped. Please use version 2 or later.
