    Watch a short video tutorial on YouTube: `Module Installation & Configuration <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGeHtJCHmyA>`_.

Each OXID eShop module has its metadata defined via the :file:`metadata.php` file, located in the module's root directory.

.. note::

    Support of metadata version 1, 1.1 and 1.2 was dropped. Please use version 2 or later.
